Lifetime value (LTV) represents the total revenue a business expects to earn from a customer throughout their entire relationship with the company. In math terms, it can be defined by:

*LTV = (Average Revenue per Customer per Day × Average Lifespan) − Cost of Acquisition*

Brands like Starbucks leverage LTV to customize their loyalty rewards, thereby enhancing customer retention and maximizing profits per customer. In the Software as a Service (SaaS) industry, companies such as Salesforce and Adobe utilize LTV to assess customer acquisition costs, with a focus on cultivating long-term relationships over short-term gains.<br />
In the dynamic and competitive world of ride-sharing, the importance of LTV takes on multiple dimensions. Estimating a driver's LTV assists companies like Uber and 99 in guiding their decision-making processes related to recruitment, training, and retention programs. It also plays a pivotal role in revenue forecasting, which is a critical component of strategizing for sustainable growth.
